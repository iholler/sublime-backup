I don't think you're happy enough. That's right, I'll teach you to be happy. I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs. Now, boys and girls, let's try it again. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy, joy. If it ain't the granddaddy of all liars. Think of the little critters of nature. They don't know that they're ugly. That's very funny, a fly marrying a bumblebee. I told you, 'I'd shoot', but you didn't believe me. Why didn't you believe me? Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, happy, happy. Happy, happy, happy, happy. Happy, happy, joy, joy, joooooy.]]></content>
